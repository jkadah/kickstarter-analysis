# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns"
- From our data, we can see that the most successful kickstarter campaigns were ones that had a goal from $1,000-$4,999, with a 68% success rate. 
Generally speaking, goals under $20,000 did better than goals more than $20,000. 
- The most unsuccessful campaigns were ones that had goals of $45000-$49000 with a 64% fail rate. 
- This is evident in the graph below.

- Many kickstarter campaigns were unsuccessful until 2013 and then had a decline again in 2017. However, that does not mean it cannot succeed now. As you can tell from the line graph, the success fluctuates and there is still a good amount that succeeds. 
However, this data set may have limitations in that it is a sample of all kickstarter data. 
- This is evident in the graph below.

- My recommendation is to have a more modest goal, specifically in the $1,000-$4,999 range. I would also recommend to not have a goal more than $20,000.
